I am also not Allen Carr. So yes I am not the author. I am the hack-author I hacked Allen Carr’s book and his method of de-addiction to adapt it for PMO. Why? Because his method helped me in getting rid of cigarettes, alcohol and then PMO. Why did I hack his work? Because he is dead now. And the institution that he had formed does not list Internet pornography as one of the addictions that it provides services for. I don’t gain monetarily or otherwise. Above all - you won’t ‘find’ me in this book. Myself and Allen will appear and disappear in this book to provide you with an unique and effective method to get your mind de-addicted. IMPORTANT ADVICE FOR YOU! DO NOT JUMP CHAPTERS! THE NUMBERS TO UNLOCK THE COMBO LOCK SHOULD BE USED IN THE GIVEN SEQUENCE! The common thread running through Allen Carr’s work is the removal of fear. Indeed, his genius lies in eliminating the phobias and anxieties which prevent people from being able to enjoy life to the full, as his best-selling books vividly demonstrate. His method is solid and has high success rates. It helped cure me of not one but three addictions. There is a network of clinics that uses his methods that span the globe and has a phenomenal reputation for success in helping people to quit addictions (except PMO). Their success rate is over 95% with money-back guarantees. Hackbook: A book based and hacked from another book. The original author is credited fully. IMPORTANT ADVICE FOR YOU! DO NOT JUMP CHAPTERS! THE NUMBERS TO UNLOCK THE COMBO LOCK SHOULD BE USED IN THE GIVEN SEQUENCE! Dr. Albert Ellis’ autobiography - “All Out!” “I used to wrongly think that most of them (addicts) were aided by self-help groups like AA, by therapy, or some other real support. But no. The facts show that more people surrender their addictions on their own-without any notable help from others. How? Mainly by seeing, acknowledging, and emphasizing how hard it is not to stop and how much easier it is-in the long run- to suffer through the withdrawal process.” "],["preface.html", "Chapter 1 Preface", " Chapter 1 Preface asd "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 2 conclusion", " Chapter 2 conclusion Sit nunc at convallis fringilla semper!
